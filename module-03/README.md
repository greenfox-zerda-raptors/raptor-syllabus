# Module 3 - Introduction Java Basics (Phase 2)

## Objectives
Become familiar with the typical components of a programming language, using Java as our guide.  This introduces concepts found in all programming languages and lays the foundation on which to then go deeper into the strengths of Java.

__As this is a short week, we spill over into next week and only have 4 days in this module.__

## Overview of Days in this Module
- [Java Environment &amp; Basic Constructs](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/teaching-materials/tree/master/java-basics/1-installing-basics)
- [Arrays, Functions and Debugging &amp; Exceptions](m03d2-arrays-collections-functions)
- [ArrayList, LinkedLists, HashMap;  Iterators, Foreach](m03d3)
- [Stringbuilder, Conversion & Casting; Functional Overloading](m03d4)

## Knowledge & Skills
The participants are expected to achieve these competences (knowledge and/or skills) by the end of this module:-
- Understanding of the basic *Turing* machine, concepts core to all programming; interpreters, compilers
- General knowledge of core components of the Java world - IDE & program, compile to bytecode, linking, running in the JVM, libraries
- Able to write and run a Java program; debug and inspect variables in an operating program
- Search for, and install a library (Maven)
- Understand primitive data types, define and use variables (in expressions)
- Craft expressions
- Control program flow - loops (while, do-while, for), statements (if, if-then, if-then-else, elseif)
- Work with arrays (single and multi-dimensional), understand what are jagged arrays
- Have an understanding of collections - ArrayList & HashMaps and be able to iterate through such
- Define functions - parameters, return values, signatures/overloading; main args[]
- Understand the String and StringBuilder objects, their differences
- Make use of simple I/O calling the Scanner class (reading from the prompt (System.in), writing to the prompt (System.out))
- Perform and explain primitive data conversions

## Demo (for end of the module)
By the end of this module, you will be expected to be conversant in the core concepts found in programming (variables, types, loops, expressions, control & functions).
 - Creating simple algorithms as searching palindromes in a string,
 - Show understanding of variables, conditionals, loops and the other basic elements of a programming language.
